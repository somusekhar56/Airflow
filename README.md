# Airflow_documentation
# Apache Airflow – Core Concepts Documentation
# Overview
Apache Airflow is an open-source workflow orchestration platform used to schedule, monitor, and manage workflows.

Workflows are defined as code (Python), which makes them dynamic, version-controlled, and scalable.

Airflow does not process data itself.

Instead, it coordinates and orchestrates tasks that run in external systems such as databases, APIs, cloud services, or compute engines.

# 1. Introduction to Apache Airflow
Apache Airflow helps in managing complex workflows by:

Defining task dependencies

Scheduling task execution

Handling retries and failures

Providing monitoring and logging
# Airflow is widely used in:

Data engineering pipelines

ETL / ELT workflows

Batch processing systems

Machine learning orchestration
# 1.1 Core Concepts
Airflow is built on four core concepts:

DAGs


Operators

Tasks

# DAG-to-DAG triggers
Understanding these concepts is essential before building pipelines.

# 1.1.1 DAG Definition (Directed Acyclic Graph)
# What is a DAG?
A DAG (Directed Acyclic Graph) represents a workflow definition in Airflow.

Directed: Tasks have a defined execution order

Acyclic: No circular dependencies are allowed

Graph: Tasks are nodes, dependencies are edges

A DAG defines what should run and in what order, but it does not execute tasks itself.

# Key Characteristics
Written in Python

Parsed continuously by the scheduler

Represents workflow structure only

Execution happens through DAG Runs

Conceptual Understanding
# A DAG is like a blueprint:

It describes the plan

It does not perform the work

Tasks are executed based on this plan
# 1.1.2 Operators
What is an Operator?
An Operator defines what kind of action should be performed.

Operators act as templates for tasks.

# Examples:

Run a Python function

Execute a shell command

Send an email

Trigger another DAG

# Common Operator Types
Action Operators: Perform actions (PythonOperator, BashOperator)

Sensor Operators: Wait for conditions (FileSensor, ExternalTaskSensor)

Transfer Operators: Move data between systems

Control Flow Operators: Control execution path
3 1.1.3 Tasks
# What is a Task?
A Task is a single execution unit in a DAG.

It is created when an operator is instantiated inside a DAG.

Task Lifecycle

Task is created by the scheduler

Task waits for dependencies

Task is queued

Executor runs the task

Status is updated (success / failed / retry)

Task Characteristics

Atomic (does one job)

Independent

Retryable

Stateless (recommended)
# 1.1.4 DAG to DAG Trigger
What is DAG-to-DAG Triggering?

DAG-to-DAG triggering allows one DAG to start another DAG.

# This is useful when workflows need to be:

Modular

Reusable

Decoupled
# How It Works
A task in DAG A triggers DAG B

DAG B starts a new DAG Run

DAGs operate independently after triggering
# Use Cases
Breaking large workflows into smaller DAGs

Event-based orchestration

Multi-stage pipelines (ingestion → transformation → reporting)
# 1.2 Scheduler
What is the Scheduler?

The Scheduler is the component responsible for deciding when tasks should run.

# It continuously:

Reads DAG files

Creates DAG Runs

Evaluates task dependencies

Sends runnable tasks to the executor

# Responsibilities
DAG parsing

Scheduling DAG Runs

Dependency resolution

Task queuing

Important Note
# The scheduler:

Does NOT execute tasks

Does NOT run business logic

Only makes scheduling decisions
# 1.3 Executor
What is an Executor?

The Executor determines how and where tasks are executed.

It acts as a bridge between:

Scheduler

Workers

Execution Flow
